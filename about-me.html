            <p>In The summer time I like to go camping with my family, we recently discovered a campground called "Lake
                Siskiyou," which is located near Mt. Shasta, California. This has become our favorite campground because
                you are in the woods, and the campground has a beautiful beach with clear blue water.</p>

        <p>When I'm not workking or studying I love to go hiking, I love hikes that have an ocean view, and I also like
            hiking trails that make you go deep into the forest, and it feels like you are miles away from civilization.
